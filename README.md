# MusicDsl (Master thesis project)
## Domain-specific language for sheet music modeling. 
Created domain-specific language simplifies the work with softwares for music composing and makes writing sheet music much easier.

MusicDsl incudes:
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Ecore metamodel;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Textual concrete syntax for creating the language;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Generators, which goal is to generate files that have formats that fit sheet music creation and reading softwares;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Generated musicxml, mscx and xml files.

Technologies used:
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Eclipse Modeling Framework for metamodel development;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet general purpose OCL language to define model constraints;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Xtext framework to create textual concrete syntax;
{\displaystyle \bullet }\bullet Xtend programing language for generators.
