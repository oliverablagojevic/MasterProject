# MusicDsl [Master thesis project, scientific discipline: Domain Specific Modeling and Languages]
## Domain-specific language for sheet music modeling. 
Created domain-specific language simplifies the work with softwares for music composing and makes writing sheet music much easier.

MusicDsl incudes:<br/>
• Ecore metamodel;<br/>
• Textual concrete syntax for creating the language;<br/>
• Generators, which goal is to generate files that have formats that fit sheet music creation and reading softwares;<br/>
• Generated musicxml, mscx and xml files.<br/>

Technologies used:<br/>
• Eclipse Modeling Framework for metamodel development;<br/>
• general purpose OCL language to define model constraints;<br/>
• Xtext framework to create textual concrete syntax;<br/>
• Xtend programing language for generators.<br/>
